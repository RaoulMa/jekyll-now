For five years, I have been working on models with one warped extra dimension, the so-called Randall-Sundrum models <a      
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9905221.pdf">[1]</a>. These models provide an interesting extension of the Standard Model, which describes elementary particles at the fundamental level.

The main motivation for Randall-Sundrum models lies in an &quot;aesthetic&quot; problem of the Standard Model, the Higgs hierarchy puzzle: put simply, it is the question why the squared Higgs mass is 34 orders of magnitude smaller than the squared Planck mass. This separation of scales is seen to be &quot;unnatural&quot;. The curvature of the 5D space-time in Randall-Sundrum models allows for an exponential redshifting of the Planck scale to the Tev scale, which reduces the &quot;natural&quot; discrepancy between the squared Higgs and Planck masses to 2-3 orders of magnitude.

In my research, I have investigated the fermion triangle diagram in the context of Randall-Sundrum models. By using the method of 5D propagators one can calculate the corresponding amplitude and show that the result differs for models with a brane-localised and a narrow bulk-Higgs sector <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.5702.pdf">[2]</a>. After understanding this calculation I have worked out the  phenomenological implications for the Higgs production process via gluon fusion. Later on, I have further investigated various other Higgs production and decay channels, which allow to significantly constrain the parameter space of Randall-Sundrum models <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5731.pdf">[3]</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.4456.pdf">[4]</a>. After working on Higgs physics, I have switched my attention to the flavour-changing transition b to s gamma. Using 5D propagators, I have calculated the leading penguin diagrams to the transition at the one-loop level <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02539.pdf">[5]</a>. With the numerical results, one can compare the predictions in the Randall-Sundrum models with several observables that are measurable at the B-factories.

However, up to now the collaborations at collider experiments have not found any significant deviation from the predictions of the Standard Model. In addition, for many models, that aim at an explanation of the Higgs hierarchy puzzle, the new physics scale gets pushed into the multi-TeV range. Consequently, the original motivation &#45; the solution to the Higgs hierarchy puzzle &#45; is under strong tension for many models beyond the Standard Model.

<!-- My viewpoint on the subject (community) of new physics has changed over the years. During my PhD I was always much more interested in the theoretical  procedure how to calculate loop diagrams in warped extra-dimensional models, than to discuss the phenomenological implications for experiments. However, I realised that the mainstream of the theoretical high-energy community, that is working on new physics models, is focused much more on the phenomenological aspect, even though there is absolutely no significant deviation of any LHC experiment from the Standard Model. One cause for the community&#96;s behaviour is surely that it is much easier to publish &quot;scientific&quot; papers on phenomenological implications of small variations of new physics models, than to work out abstract theoretical aspects. <br><br> -->

During my diploma studies I was a research assistant in the QUANTUM group of Prof. Dr. Arnold Rauschenbeutel. My project was to construct an optical fiber-based biosensor. The idea was that the absorption/scattering of the evanescent radiation field of the very thin glass-fiber (diameter of 500nm) is sensitive to the type of molecules that are close or attached to the fiber <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/mixed/Project_OpticalFiberBasedBiosensor.pdf"> (summary in German) </a>.

In school I have taken part in "jugend forscht", which is a German Youth Science Competition. My project was to navigate a small vehicle by speaking commands into a microphone. I have written a C++ program that calculated the Mel-Frequency-Cepstral (MFC) coefficients of a voice recording. I trained my program with voice recordings for words like forwards, backwards, left, right and stop. Then, in the test phase the program classified the current voice recording, which worked quite well if the surroundings were not too noisy <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/mixed/Project_SpeechRecognition.pdf"> (summary in German) </a>.
