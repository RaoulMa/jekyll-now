        </a> of a friend of mine. Her paintings are reflections on the effects of human actions on fragile ecosystems like 
        forests, coral reefs and the world of insects. Through the process of painting, she adopts the visual vocabulary of 
        these fascinating biospheres. Furthermore, she develops new painting techniques to capture the diversity of organisms 
        and creatures, by implementing experiments with different substances and surfaces.

    During my diploma studies I was a research assistant in the QUANTUM group of Prof. Dr. Arnold Rauschenbeutel. My project 
    was to construct an optical fiber-based biosensor. The idea was that the absorption/scattering of the evanescent radiation 
    field of the very thin glass-fiber (diameter of 500nm) is sensitive to the type of molecules that are close or attached to 
    the fiber <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/mixed/Project_OpticalFiberBasedBiosensor.pdf"> (summary in German) </a>.

        In school I have taken part in "jugend forscht", which is a German Youth Science Competition. My project was to             
        navigate a small vehicle by speaking commands into a microphone. I have written a C++ program that calculated the Mel-
        Frequency-Cepstral (MFC) coefficients of a voice recording. I trained my program with voice recordings for words like 
        forwards, backwards, left, right and stop. Then, in the test phase the program classified the current voice recording, 
        which worked quite well if the surroundings were not too noisy <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/mixed/Project_SpeechRecognition.pdf"> (summary in German) </a>.
