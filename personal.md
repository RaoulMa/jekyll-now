If you are interested in arts please check out the website <a href = "http://www.annalisatheisen.de"> annalisatheisen.de </a> of a friend of mine. Her paintings are reflections on the effects of human actions on fragile ecosystems like forests, coral reefs and the world of insects. Through the process of painting, she adopts the visual vocabulary of these fascinating biospheres. Furthermore, she develops new painting techniques to capture the diversity of organisms and creatures, by implementing experiments with different substances and surfaces.

I was solo hiking in the Khumbu region of Nepal. The adventure started with flying from Kathmandu to the Tenzing-Hillary airport in Lukla, which can only be approached during daylight hours in good weather. During 13 days I crossed two passes (Cho La at 5420m, Renjo La at 5360m), climbed 4 mountains (Chukhung Ri at 5550m, Gokyo Ri at 5357m, Kala Patthar at 5645m, Nangkar Tshang at 5083m), and visited Everest Basecamp at 5364m.

Amazing trip in the Mont Blanc massif with Josh and Manu. After breakfast at 1:30am in the Refuge de Tete Rousse (3167m), I crossed the  Grand Couloir, climbed up to the Refuge du Gouter and continued ascending to the Dome du Gouter. Since weather and snow  conditions were perfect, I reached the summit of Mont Blanc at 10:15am, having clear views over the French and Italian parts of the Mont Blanc massif. It took 3 more hours to descent to the Refuge du Gouter.

I participated in the Scott Rock Zugspitze marathon starting in Ehrwald and going up to the highest point in Germany at 2962m above sea level, which lies in the Bavarian Alps. The event started at 5am in the morning in rainy conditions. Shortly after the start the weather cleared up, and it took me 9:45 hours to complete the marathon (3965m ascend, 1993m descend) and to reach the summit of Zugspitze.

    During my diploma studies I was a research assistant in the group of Prof. Dr. Arnold Rauschenbeutel. My project 
    was to construct an optical fiber-based biosensor. The idea was that the scattering of the evanescent radiation 
    field of a very thin glass-fiber is sensitive to the type of molecules that are close or attached to 
    the fiber <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/mixed/Project_OpticalFiberBasedBiosensor.pdf"> (summary in German) </a>.<br>

        In school I have taken part in "jugend forscht", which is a German Youth Science Competition. My project was to             
        navigate a small vehicle by speaking commands into a microphone. I have written a C++ program that calculated the Mel-
        Frequency-Cepstral coefficients of a voice recording. I trained my program with voice recordings for words like 
        forwards, backwards, left, right and stop. Then, in the test phase the program classified the current voice recording, 
        which worked quite well if the surroundings were not too noisy <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/mixed/Project_SpeechRecognition.pdf"> (summary in German) </a>.
