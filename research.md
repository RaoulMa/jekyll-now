For five years, I have been working on models with one warped extra dimension, the so-called Randall-Sundrum models <a      
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9905221.pdf">[1]</a>. These models provide an interesting extension of the Standard Model, which describes elementary particles at the fundamental level. 

<br><br>

The main motivation for Randall-Sundrum models lies in an &quot;aesthetic&quot; problem of the Standard Model, the Higgs hierarchy puzzle: put simply, it is the question why the squared Higgs mass is 34 orders of magnitude smaller than the squared Planck mass. This separation of scales is seen to be &quot;unnatural&quot;. The curvature of the 5D space-time in Randall-Sundrum models allows for an exponential redshifting of the Planck scale to the Tev scale, which reduces the &quot;natural&quot; discrepancy between the squared Higgs and Planck masses to 2-3 orders of magnitude.
        
<br><br>

In my research, I have investigated the fermion triangle diagram in the context of Randall-Sundrum models. By using the method of 5D propagators one can calculate the corresponding amplitude and show that the result differs for models with a brane-localised and a narrow bulk-Higgs sector <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.5702.pdf">[2]</a>. After understanding this calculation I have worked out the  phenomenological implications for the Higgs production process via gluon fusion. Later on, I have further investigated various other Higgs production and decay channels, which allow to significantly constrain the parameter space of Randall-Sundrum models <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5731.pdf">[3]</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.4456.pdf">[4]</a>. After working on Higgs physics, I have switched my attention to the flavour-changing transition b to s gamma. Using 5D propagators, I have calculated the leading penguin diagrams to the transition at the one-loop level <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02539.pdf">[5]</a>. With the numerical results, one can compare the predictions in the Randall-Sundrum models with several observables that are measurable at the B-factories. 

<br><br>

However, up to now the collaborations at collider experiments have not found any significant deviation from the predictions of the Standard Model. In addition, for many models, that aim at an explanation of the Higgs hierarchy puzzle, the new physics scale gets pushed into the multi-TeV range. Consequently, the original motivation &#45; the solution to the Higgs hierarchy puzzle &#45; is under strong tension for many models beyond the Standard Model.
