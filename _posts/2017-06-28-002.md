Mont Blanc, June 2017

Amazing trip together in the Mont Blanc massif. After breakfast at 1:30am in 
the Refuge de Tete Rousse (3167m), we crossed the Grand Couloir, climbed up to the Refuge du Gouter and continued 
ascending to the Dome du Gouter. Since weather and snow conditions were perfect, I reached the summit of Mont Blanc at 10:15am, 
having clear views over the French and Italian parts of the Mont Blanc massif. It took 3 more hours to descent to the 
Refuge du Gouter.
