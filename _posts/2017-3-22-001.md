In the beginning of March 2017 I was trekking in the Khumbu region of Nepal. During 13 days of great adventure I crossed two passes (Cho La at 5420m, Renjo La at 5360m), climbed 4 mountains (Chukhung Ri at 5550m, Gokyo Ri at 5357m, Kala Patthar at 5645m, Nangkar Tshang at 5083m), and visited Everest Basecamp at 5364m.
