Currently, I'm very interested in understanding deep learning networks from a mathematical and physical 
point of view, see for instance this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08225">paper</a>. Moreover, I have 
been writing kernels for several kaggle competitions, e.g. recently a Python <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/raoulma/nuclei-segmentation-tensorflow-u-net-0-327-prec">script</a> 
which implements a U-Net shaped convolutional neural network for nuclei segmentation of the images
provided by the 2018 Data Science Bowl.

My scientific background is in physics. I have obtained my diploma and PhD in theoretical elementary particle physics 
at the <href a="http://www.thep.physik.uni-mainz.de/index.php">Johannes Gutenberg-University</a> in Mainz, Germany, 
under the supervision of 
<a href="http://www.thep.physik.uni-mainz.de/45.php#L_Neubert__Prof__Dr__Matthias">Prof. Dr. Matthias Neubert</a>. 
In my research I have investigated Higgs and flavour physics in models with one warped extra dimension, the so-called 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9905221.pdf"> Randall-Sundrum </a> models.
My work involved model building for elementary particles and the analytical calculation of 
Feynman loop-diagrams in a 5-dimensional warped space-time and the subsequent numerical analysis using Mathematica and C++. 
The predictions can then be tested in particle collision experiments like the Large Hadron Collider at 
<a href="https://home.cern/"> CERN </a> near Geneva. I have written peer-reviewed scientific papers, taught tutorials 
on advanced physics courses, and given talks about my research.
