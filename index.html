I have finished my PhD in theoretical high energy physics at the Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz, Germany. 
In my work, I was investigating extra-dimensional models that might describe the interactions between fundamental particles. 
Besides my scientific research, I'm interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, financial mathematics, bouldering, mountain climbing and trail running.

A short version of my CV is given below. For a more detailed version visit <https://www.linkedin.com/in/raoulmalm>.
