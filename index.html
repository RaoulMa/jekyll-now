I have finished my PhD in theoretical high energy physics at the Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz, Germany. In my 
research I have investigated Higgs and flavour physics in models with one warped extra dimension, the so-called 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9905221.pdf"> Randall-Sundrum </a> models. My work involved the analytical calculation of 
Feynman loop-diagrams in a 5-dimensional warped space-time and the subsequent numerical analysis using Mathematica and C++. 
The predictions can then be tested in particle collision experiments like the Large Hadron Collider at 
<a href="https://home.cern/"> CERN </a> near Geneva.

Besides my PhD work, I'm very interested in deep learning and financial engineering. Especially, deep neural 
networks are a fascinating subject to investigate and to understand from a mathematical and physical viewpoint.
