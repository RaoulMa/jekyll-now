I have finished my PhD in theoretical high energy physics at the Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz, Germany. 
In my work I was investigating Higgs and flavour physics in models with one warped extra dimension (Randall-Sundrum models). 
The predictions can be tested at experiments like the Large Hadron Collider. My work involved the analytical calculation of 
Feynman loop-diagrams in a 5-dimensional warped space-time and the subsequent numerical analysis using Mathematica and C++.

Besides my PhD work, I'm interested in artificial intelligence and financial engineering. Especially, deep neural 
networks are a fascinating subject and tool to solve complicated machine-learning problems.
