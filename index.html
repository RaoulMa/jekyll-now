Welcome to my homepage. My name is Raoul and I'm interested in 
<a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ehinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf">deep learning</a>, 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05866">reinforcement learning</a> and computer vision. Currently, I'm a research postdoc at the Dalle Molle institute for artificial intelligence (<a>IDSIA</a>) in Lugano, Switzerland in the group of <a href="">Prof. Dr. Juergen Schmidhuber</a>. 
<!-- 
In general, I'm very interested in  
<a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ehinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf">deep learning</a>,   
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05866">reinforcement learning</a> and computer vision.
Theoretically, I am interested in 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5538">representation learning</a>
(e.g. discover explanatory factors of 
the environment, deep generative adversarial models), 
in general properties of deep neural networks 
(e.g. expressivity, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530">generalisation</a>) and 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08097">geometric deep learning</a> (e.g. anisotropic convolution).  
Practically, I am interested in deep learning applications for computer vision (e.g. bio-medical image analysis, robotics), 
bio-informatics (e.g. protein structure prediction) and climate science (e.g. extreme weather 
forecasting). 
I have been writing <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/raoulma/kernels">kernels</a> for several kaggle competitions, e.g. 
recently Python <a href="https://github.com/RaoulMa/Data_Science_Bowl_2018">code</a> 
which implements a U-Net shaped convolutional neural network using TensorFlow and OpenCV for nuclei segmentation of the images
provided by the 2018 Data Science Bowl, and where the computation is performed on a Nvidia GPU in the Google cloud. I finished 
the contest in the top 14%.

In my research I have investigated Higgs and flavour physics in models with one warped extra dimension, the so-called <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9905221.pdf"> Randall-Sundrum </a> models. My work involved model building for elementary particles and the analytical calculation of Feynman loop-diagrams in a 5-dimensional warped space-time and the subsequent numerical analysis using Mathematica and C++.

<strong> Short biography </strong>
<ul> Raoul Malm is currently a research postdoc at the Dalle Molle institute for artificial intelligence (IDSIA) in Lugano, in the group of Prof. Dr. Juergen Schmidhuber. Before that, he obtained his Phd in theoretical high energy physics at the MITP of the University of Mainz, Germany in the group of Prof. Dr. Matthias Neubert. In his PhD he investigated Higgs and flavour physics in models with one warped extra dimension. After his PhD his interests have shifted towards the area of deep learning and reinforcement learning.

<strong>Introduction to my work in theoretical high energy physics</strong>
<ul>
For five years, I have been working on models with one warped extra dimension, the so-called Randall-Sundrum models <a      
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9905221.pdf">[1]</a>. These models provide an interesting extension of the Standard Model, which describes elementary particles at the fundamental level.

<br> 
The main motivation for Randall-Sundrum models lies in an &quot;aesthetic&quot; problem of the Standard Model, the Higgs hierarchy puzzle: put simply, it is the question why the squared Higgs mass is 34 orders of magnitude smaller than the squared Planck mass. This separation of scales is seen to be &quot;unnatural&quot;. The curvature of the 5D space-time in Randall-Sundrum models allows for an exponential redshifting of the Planck scale to the Tev scale, which reduces the &quot;natural&quot; discrepancy between the squared Higgs and Planck masses to 2-3 orders of magnitude.
<br><br>
In my research, I have investigated the fermion triangle diagram in the context of Randall-Sundrum models. By using the method of 5D propagators one can calculate the corresponding amplitude and show that the result differs for models with a brane-localised and a narrow bulk-Higgs sector <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.5702.pdf">[2]</a>. After understanding this calculation I have worked out the  phenomenological implications for the Higgs production process via gluon fusion. Later on, I have further investigated various other Higgs production and decay channels, which allow to significantly constrain the parameter space of Randall-Sundrum models <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5731.pdf">[3]</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.4456.pdf">[4]</a>. After working on Higgs physics, I have switched my attention to the flavour-changing transition b to s gamma. Using 5D propagators, I have calculated the leading penguin diagrams to the transition at the one-loop level <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02539.pdf">[5]</a>. With the numerical results, one can compare the predictions in the Randall-Sundrum models with several observables that are measurable at the B-factories.

<br>
However, up to now the collaborations at collider experiments have not found any significant deviation from the predictions of the Standard Model. In addition, for many models, that aim at an explanation of the Higgs hierarchy puzzle, the new physics scale gets pushed into the multi-TeV range. Consequently, the original motivation &#45; the solution to the Higgs hierarchy puzzle &#45; is under strong tension for many models beyond the Standard Model.
