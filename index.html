I'm very interested in the theory and application of deep learning, which represents a promising 
ingredient towards artifical general intelligence. Theoretically, interesting research topics concern the 
understanding of deep neural networks (generalisation, capacity, optimization etc.), 
 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05866">deep reinforcement learning</a>, neural 
network architectures (Convolution, Autoencoder, LSTM/GRU, RBM etc.) and the combination with reinforcement learning. 
Practically, interesting applications are in computer vision (e.g. using geometric deep learning for 
bio-medical image analysis based on non-Euclidean data) and robotics.
<!--I'm very interested in the theory of deep learning from a mathematical and physical 
point of view, see for instance <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08225">this</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530">this</a> paper. Apart from neural 
network theory I am interested in applications based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08097">geometric deep learning</a> and 
 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05866">deep reinforcement learning</a>.

Moreover, I have been writing kernels for several kaggle competitions, e.g. 
recently a Python <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/raoulma/nuclei-segmentation-tensorflow-u-net-0-327-prec">script</a> 
which implements a U-Net shaped convolutional neural network in TensorFlow for nuclei segmentation of the images
provided by the 2018 Data Science Bowl.

My scientific background is in physics. I have obtained my diploma and PhD in 
<a href="http://www.thep.physik.uni-mainz.de/">theoretical high energy physics</a> 
at the <a href="http://www.thep.physik.uni-mainz.de/index.php">Johannes Gutenberg-University</a> in Mainz, Germany, 
under the supervision of 
<a href="http://www.thep.physik.uni-mainz.de/45.php#L_Neubert__Prof__Dr__Matthias">Prof. Dr. Matthias Neubert</a>. 
In my research I have investigated Higgs and flavour physics in models with one warped extra dimension, the so-called 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9905221.pdf"> Randall-Sundrum </a> models.
My work involved model building for elementary particles and the analytical calculation of 
Feynman loop-diagrams in a 5-dimensional warped space-time and the subsequent numerical analysis using Mathematica and C++. 
The predictions can then be tested in particle collision experiments like the Large Hadron Collider at 
<a href="https://home.cern/"> CERN </a> near Geneva. I have written peer-reviewed scientific papers, taught tutorials 
on advanced physics courses, and given talks about my research. 
<br><br>
During my PhD I was awarded a membership of the 
<a href='https://www.gutenberg-academy.uni-mainz.de/'>Gutenberg Academy</a> which is given to the best 25 young 
researcher of the entire Johannes-Gutenberg University Mainz. I finished my PhD with the highest grade possible 
(0.7, summa cum laude) and was awarded an endowed prize by "<a href='https://www.freunde.uni-mainz.de/>
'Friends of Mainz University</a>" for my thesis.
