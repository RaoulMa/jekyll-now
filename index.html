Currently, I'm very interested in understanding deep learning networks from a mathematical and physical 
viewpoint, see for instance this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08225"> paper </a>. Moreover, I have 
been writing kernels for several kaggle competitions, e.g. recently a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/raoulma/nuclei-segmentation-tensorflow-u-net-0-327-prec"> Python script </a> 
which implements a U-Net shaped convolutional neural network for nuclei segmentation of the images
provides by the 2018 Data Science Bowl.

My scientific background is in physics. I have finished my PhD in theoretical elementary particle physics at the Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz, Germany. In my 
research I have investigated Higgs and flavour physics in models with one warped extra dimension, the so-called 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9905221.pdf"> Randall-Sundrum </a> models. My work involved the analytical calculation of 
Feynman loop-diagrams in a 5-dimensional warped space-time and the subsequent numerical analysis using Mathematica and C++. 
The predictions can then be tested in particle collision experiments like the Large Hadron Collider at 
<a href="https://home.cern/"> CERN </a> near Geneva.
