I'm very interested in  
<a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ehinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf">deep learning</a> and  
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05866">deep reinforcement learning</a>, which are promising ingredients
towards general purpose intelligence. 
Theoretically, I am interested in 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5538">representation learning</a>
(e.g. discover explanatory factors of 
the environment, deep generative adversarial models), 
in general properties of deep neural networks 
(e.g. expressivity, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530">generalisation</a>) and 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08097">geometric deep learning</a> (e.g. anisotropic convolution).  
Practically, I am interested in deep learning applications for computer vision (e.g. bio-medical image analysis, robotics), 
bio-informatics (e.g. protein structure prediction) and climate science (e.g. extreme weather 
forecasting). 
Moreover, I have been writing <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/raoulma/kernels">kernels</a> for several kaggle competitions, e.g. 
recently Python <a href="https://github.com/RaoulMa/Data_Science_Bowl_2018">code</a> 
which implements a U-Net shaped convolutional neural network in TensorFlow for nuclei segmentation of the images
provided by the 2018 Data Science Bowl.

My scientific background is in physics. I have obtained my diploma and PhD in 
<a href="http://www.thep.physik.uni-mainz.de/">theoretical high energy physics</a> 
at the <a href="http://www.thep.physik.uni-mainz.de/index.php">Johannes Gutenberg-University</a> in Mainz, Germany, 
under the supervision of 
<a href="http://www.thep.physik.uni-mainz.de/45.php#L_Neubert__Prof__Dr__Matthias">Prof. Dr. Matthias Neubert</a>. 
In my research I have investigated Higgs and flavour physics in models with one warped extra dimension, the so-called 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9905221.pdf"> Randall-Sundrum </a> models.
My work involved model building for elementary particles and the analytical calculation of 
Feynman loop-diagrams in a 5-dimensional warped space-time and the subsequent numerical analysis using Mathematica and C++. 
The predictions can then be tested in particle collision experiments like the Large Hadron Collider at 
<a href="https://home.cern/"> CERN </a> near Geneva. I have written peer-reviewed scientific papers, taught tutorials 
on advanced physics courses, and given talks about my research. 
<br><br>
I finished my PhD with distinction (grade: 0.7, summa cum laude) and was awarded an endowed prize 
by <a href="https://www.freunde.uni-mainz.de/">Friends of Mainz University</a>. 
During my PhD I was awarded a membership of the 
<a href="https://www.gutenberg-academy.uni-mainz.de/">Gutenberg Academy</a> which is given each year to the best 25 
PhD students of the entire Johannes-Gutenberg University Mainz. My diploma thesis (grade: 1.0, very good) was 
awarded an endowed prize 
by the faculty Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science of the Johannes-Gutenberg University Mainz. 
During High School I won 
at the regional level the German youth science competition <a href="https://www.jugend-forscht.de/">jugend forscht</a>
for writing a speech recognition software.
