I have finished my PhD in theoretical high energy physics at the Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz, Germany. In my work, I was investigating extra-dimensional models that might describe the interactions between fundamental particles. Besides my scientific research, I'm interested in artificial intelligence, financial mathematics, bouldering, mountain climbing and trail running.
