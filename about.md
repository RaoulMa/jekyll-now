Hello, my name is Raoul. I have finished my PhD at the Institute for Physics at the Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz. In my work, I was investigating extra-dimensional models that might describe the interactions between fundamental particles. Besides my own scientific research, IÃ­m interested in artificial intelligence, financial mathematics, bouldering, mountain climbing and trail running.
